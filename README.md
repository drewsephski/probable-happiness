This repository is an informational website for medication users to check for interactions between drugs. The 3 main types of drug interactions include: 

Additivity: when the effect of two drugs given in combination equals the mathematical summation of their effects when given alone.

Synergism: when the combine effect of two drugs is greater than the sum of their effects when given separately.

Potentiation: when one drug does not elicit a response on its own but enhances the response to another drug.
